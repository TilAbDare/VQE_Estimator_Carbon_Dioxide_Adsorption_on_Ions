# VQE_Estimator_Carbon_Dioxide_Adsorption_on_Ions
Implementation of VQE algorithm by VQE_Estimator to calculate the total energies for carbon dioxide adsorption on Magnesium ion. 
The simulation was done by perfect, noisy, and physical qubits. To reduce the size of the problem active space transformation was applied to the system. According to the file of the active space, the selected orbitals can be manipulated for down or upsizing the system. The ansatz in the noisy and physical simulation was parameterized by the optimal points achieved by perfect simulation. But they can be parameterized randomly as well.
